    <P>

        
        My name is Lethabo Sekgobela, a final-year Computer Science student.  
        I am navigating the exciting yet challenging transition from coding simple algorithms to creating websites and developing apps. Being a tech girl has always been my dream. At first, developing apps seemed complicated, and the idea of starting my own felt almost impossible.  

        If someone had told me in 2023 that I would be here today — in my final year, about to create my first website — I would have laughed. These goals once felt intimidating, even though I always wanted to be part of them.  

        Now, I am eager to overcome my fears, create more, develop more, and deepen my understanding of technology. The future needs more tech innovators, and I am proud to contribute, showing other girls that their dreams are possible.  

        I am truly excited to embrace this next chapter of my life!
