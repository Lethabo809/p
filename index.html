    <h1 style="color: pink;">ABOUT ME</h1>
    <P>

        
    My name is Lethabo Sekgobela, a final-year Computer Science student, and this is my first step into the world of web development. Transitioning from coding simple algorithms to building websites and apps is both thrilling and challenging, but I am excited for the journey ahead.  

    Being a tech girl has always been my dream. Developing apps once seemed complicated and unattainable, and the idea of creating my own website felt like a distant goal — almost impossible. Yet here I am today, ready to turn those fears into action and explore everything this field has to offer.  

    I am eager to learn, create, and grow, and I hope to inspire other young girls who may doubt their abilities in tech. The future needs more innovators, and I am determined to contribute, proving that passion and persistence can make the impossible possible.  

    This journey is about curiosity, creativity, and resilience. Every line of code I write is a step toward realizing my dreams and breaking barriers in the tech world.  

    This is just the beginning, and I am excited to embrace this chapter of my life fully.
